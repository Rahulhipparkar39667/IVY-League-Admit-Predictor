# About Project
In this project, I built a Linear Regression model to predict the chances of admission to Ivy League colleges. Using features like GRE scores, undergraduate GPA, and other applicant information, the model aimed to provide a probability score for admission likelihood. I applied model diagnostics such as checking for multicollinearity through Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), ensuring homoscedasticity to verify consistent variance of residuals, and examining the normality of residuals. The model's performance was strong, with an R-squared value of 81%, indicating a good fit to the data.
